# Getting Started — Cloning the Repository in Eclipse

## Prerequisites

- Eclipse IDE installed on your machine

- Make sure you have Git installed and available on your system PATH

- You have access to the project repository (ensure you have been granted permissions)

## Steps 

### 1. Copy the GitHub Repository

Navigate to the repository on GitHub/GitLab/etc.
Click the green Code button and copy the HTTPS or SSH URL.

### 2. Open Eclipse and Launch the Import Wizard

Open Eclipse and select your desired workspace.
From the menu bar, go to File → Import.

### 3. Select the Git Import Option

In the Import dialog, expand the Git folder.
Select Projects from Git and click Next.

### 4. Choose "Clone URI"

Select Clone URI and click Next.

### 5. Enter the Repository Details

Paste the repository URL into the URI field. Eclipse will auto-populate the Host and Repository Path fields.
Enter your Git credentials (username and password/token) if prompted.
Click Next.

### 6. Select the Branch

Select the branch(es) you want to clone (typically main or develop).
Click Next.

### 7. Choose a Local Destination

Choose the local directory where the repository will be stored on your machine.
Click Next.

### 8. Import the Project into Eclipse

Select Import existing Eclipse projects and click Next.
Ensure your project is checked in the list and click Finish.

### 9. Verify the Setup

The project should now appear in your Package Explorer or Project Explorer panel.
Right-click the project and select Refresh if files do not appear immediately.


## Troubleshooting

### Git not recognized?

Ensure Git is installed and Eclipse is configured to find it under Window → Preferences → Team → Git → Configuration.

### Authentication failed?

If your repository uses two-factor authentication, use a personal access token instead of your password. You can create this token by: 

→ Going to GitHub

→ Click on Profile Picture 

→ Settings 

→ Developer Settings @ the Bottom of Left Sidebar 

→ Personal Access Tokens on Left Sidebar 

→ Tokens (classic) 

→ Generate new Token 

→ Generate new Token (classic) 

→ Give the token a Note, Expiry, and Toggle Access to repo 

→ Click Generate token @ bottom of screen 

→ **COPY YOUR KEY IMMEDIATELY AS YOU WILL LOSE ACCESS TO IT THE MOMENT YOU LEAVE THE SCREEN**

<h3>Project not building?</h3>
Check that your JDK/JRE is properly configured under Window → Preferences → Java → Installed JREs.
